## Installation

### Setup Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Django

Install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Create a New Django Project

Generate a new Django project using the Django admin tool:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

### Initial Migrations & Superuser

Run the initial migrations to set up your database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up your admin credentials.

## Usage

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server by running:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your project running.

### Creating a New App

Create a new Django app to add functionality:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```
Then, add 'myapp' to the INSTALLED_APPS list in myproject/settings.py.

### Adding a Simple View

Edit myapp/views.py:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
```

Configure URL patterns in myproject/urls.py:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from myapp.views import home

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', home),
]
```
Restart the server and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your view in action.

## Admin Setup

Access the Django admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ using the superuser credentials you created.

## Build Your Django App

1. Create a new app:
